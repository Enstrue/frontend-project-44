**Brain Games** is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile brain-training applications. Each game poses questions that require correct answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered passed. Incorrect answers conclude the game and suggest starting over. The games include:

- Calculator: Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
- Progression: Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
- Determining an even number.
- Determining the greatest common divisor.
- Determining a prime number.
